# My CTF Write Ups

Iâ€™m the **Team Lead & Admin of N0C715 (also known as N Ã˜ C T I S)**.  
Our team learns **cybersecurity through Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges** â€” a fun, practical way to build real-world hacking skills and create solid **CTF writeups** for the community.

## Why Play CTFs?

CTFs are practical hacking games that teach and test skills across:

1. **Web Exploitation** â€“ Finding and fixing website vulnerabilities  
2. **Forensics** â€“ Analyzing digital artifacts to uncover hidden data  
3. **Cryptography** â€“ Breaking ciphers and understanding modern encryption  
4. **Reverse Engineering & Binary Exploitation (Pwn)** â€“ Understanding how programs work and finding weaknesses  

If youâ€™re serious about **learning cybersecurity**, CTFs are beginner-friendly, community-driven, and always hands-on.
