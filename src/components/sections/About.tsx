        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hey 👋 I’m <strong>Saket Kesar</strong> — learning and growing in cybersecurity. I take it step by step, always curious, because there’s always something new to explore.</p>

        <p>You might be wondering: “Why all the Ben 10 references here?” Well, I grew up watching Ben 10, and my favorite alien was <strong>Grey Matter</strong> 🧠 — the tiny genius who could hack anything. To me, it felt like the real hacker of the Omnitrix.</p>

        <p>Since childhood, I’ve also been obsessed with watches ⌚. Maybe that’s why the Omnitrix clicked with me so much — just a gadget on your wrist that could turn you into a hero.</p>

        <h2>Some of the things I like working on are:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>🖥️ Reverse engineering</li>
          <li>🤖 Telegram bot development</li>
          <li>🐍 Python scripting</li>
          <li>⚡ Pwn tools</li>
          <li>🔍 A bit of OSINT</li>
          <li>🌐 A little web security</li>
        </ul>
